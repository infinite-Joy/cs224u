    "\n",
    "[Socher et al. 2013](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1170.pdf) compare against a Naive Bayes baseline with bigram features. See how close you can come to reproducing the performance of this model on the binary, root-only problem (values in the rightmost column of their Table 1, rows 1 and 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a bigrams feature function, on the model of `unigrams_phi`. Call this `bigrams_phi`. In writing this function, ensure that each example is padded with start and end symbols (say, `<S>` and `</S>`), so that these contexts are properly reflected in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `fit_nb_classifier_with_crossvalidation` that serves as a wrapper for `sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and searches over these values for the smoothing parameter `alpha`: `[0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]`, using 3-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `sst.experiment` to run the experiments, assessing against `dev_reader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__To submit:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your `bigrams_phi`\n",
    "1. Your `fit_nb_classifier`\n",
    "1. Your call to `sst.experiment` \n",
    "1. The average F1 score that `sst.experiment` reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "__A note on performance__: in our experience, the bigrams Naive Bayes model gets around 0.75. It's fine to submit answers with comparable numbers; the Socher et al. baselines are very strong. We're not evaluating how good your model is; we want to see your code, and we're interested to see what the range of F1 scores is across the whole class."

    "\n",
    "In the section [Distributed representations as features](sst_03_neural_networks.ipynb#Distributed-representations-as-features), we looked at a baseline for the binary SST problem in which each example is modeled as the sum of its 50-dimensional GloVe representations. A `LogisticRegression` model was used for prediction. A neural network might do better here, since there might be complex relationships between the input feature dimensions that a linear classifier can't learn. \n",

    "To address this question, rerun the experiment with `tf_shallow_neural_classifier.TfShallowNeuralClassifier` as the classifier. Specs:\n",

    "* Using 3-fold cross-validation, exhaustively explore this set of hyperparameter combinations:\n",
    "  * The hidden dimensionality at 50, 100, and 200.\n",

    "No need to include your supporting code. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're not evaluating the quality of your model. (We've specified the protocols completely, but there will still be a  lot of variation in the results.) However, the primary goal of this question is to get you thinking more about this strikingly good baseline feature representation scheme for SST, so we're sort of hoping you feel compelled to try out variations on your own."
